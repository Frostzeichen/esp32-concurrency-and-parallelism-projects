# ESP32 Concurrency and Parallelism Projects
This repository contains practice projects I've made while trying to multitask with the ESP32 and its two 32-bit cores.

While I'd like to do my best to arrange these in terms of complexity, these are mostly arranged in terms of _when_ I've tried to do them. Anyone is free to look at these to try and learn how to multitask on the ESP32 using Arduino. This is mostly just a learning reference.

## Flashing Using Make
On **Visual Studio Code**, run the `PlatformIO: Open PlatformIO Core CLI` command to activate the PlatformIO CLI on the integrated terminal. Then you can run `make` within the folder of the code you're trying to flash into your ESP32.

## Hardware Requirements
Unless specified within a readme file, expect all projects to use the NodeMCU-32S by default.
