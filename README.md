# ESP32 Concurrency and Parallelism Projects
This repository contains practice projects I've made while trying to multitask with the ESP32 and its two 32-bit cores.

While I'd like to do my best to arrange these in terms of complexity, these are mostly arranged in terms of _when_ I've tried to do them.

Anyone is free to look at these to try and learn how to multitask on the ESP32 using Arduino. This is mostly just a learning reference.
